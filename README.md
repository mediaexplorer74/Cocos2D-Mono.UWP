# Cocos2D-Mono.UWP
My fork of [Cocos2D-Mono](https://github.com/brandmooffin/cocos2d-mono/).

## About
Cocos2D-Mono focuses more on the MonoGame Framework and removes the limitations from proper XNA which held the original Cocos2D-XNA project back.

I fix the problem that UWP sample not compiled normally for W10M target (reason: min. os build must be >=16299).

## Screenshots

# Build Status
UWP: W10M with min. os build 15063 now supported. All Cocos2D-Mono adapted for this requaronments.

# Download and Run
To obtain the code you will need a git client.  Either command line or graphical.

Using the git command line you will need to clone the git repository.

> $ git clone https://github.com/mediaexplorer/cocos2d-mono.UWP.git

Wait until the clone has finished.

You should see something similar to the following:

You now have everything you need to start start developing with Cocos2D-Mono :)

## Tech Note
Cocos2D-Mono is currently built with MonoGame Framework 3.8 and included as a nuget package, so no need to pull the MonoGame source code! (Unless you want to anyways, then go for it)

## Getting Started : My UWP Sample
W10M adapted samples is [here](https://github.com/mediaexplorer/cocos2d-mono.UWP/tree/master/Samples/Uwp/Cocos2dMonoGame.Uwp)

Feel free to clone it and dev your own little cocos2d-compatible game for Windows 10 Mobile os.
